# Online-Examination-System



## Description

The Online Exam System is a simple Java-based application that simulates the process of logging in, taking an exam, and submitting the results. The system allows a user to register, login, answer multiple-choice questions, and view the final score upon submission. It has basic functionality for handling user authentication, tracking the time, and calculating scores based on correct answers.

## Features

- **User Registration**: A user can create an account by providing a username and password.
- **Login and Authentication**: Users must log in using their registered credentials before taking the exam.
- **Timed Exam**: The exam has a 10-minute time limit for completion. Users can submit their answers before the time expires.
- **Multiple Choice Questions**: Each question has two options, and users can select one answer.
- **Score Calculation**: After the exam is submitted, the system compares the user's answers with the correct ones and calculates the score.
- **Logout**: Once the exam is completed, the user can log out of the system.
